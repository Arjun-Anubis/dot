The most glaring of which is the white reading pane while running a dark theme, which isn't very kind to my eyes.\n\nSecond, I wish the list of articles could be shown in a bit less compact way. As it stands, the list feels cramped. The font is small, making it hard to read and look at without it feeling somewhat busy. There are many other RSS readers out there which have this more \"cozy\" size of the article list UI. Would like to be able to toggle a \"compact\" and \"cozy\" size.\nAlso, the \"Add Feed\" button ought to be on the toolbar by default ",

The main issue and reason why I deleted the app is because if you ask the software to delete a folder or feed it will not. This first happened when I was trying to delete some of the default folders like Spanish Feeds. No matter how many times you select and tell the folder to delete itself, it will just ignore your request. In comparison, I also tried Liferea. That software seems to work perfectly.",
